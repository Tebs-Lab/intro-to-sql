# Exercise: Joins

Use this SQL block to create the simple books database (if you've been following along, you wonh't need to do this).

```sql
-- Working with the database we defined in the schema design basics, copied here for ease.
-- The walkthrough starts on line 88.

    name text

CREATE TABLE book (
    book_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    publish_date DATE, -- Allowed to be null because our DB may contain some unpublished books.
    price DEC(6, 2)   -- 6 significant figures, 2 after the decimal, meaning 9999.99 is our "most expensive" possible book.
);

CREATE TABLE book_author (
    book_id BIGSERIAL REFERENCES book(book_id),
    author_id BIGSERIAL REFERENCES author(author_id),
    CONSTRAINT pk_book_author PRIMARY KEY (book_id, author_id)

# The Exercise:

Write a SQL query for each of the following prompts.

1. Write a query that returns the title and author(s) of every book in our dataset, but does NOT include any authors who have not written a book.

2. Write a query that returns just the title of each book that does not have any reviews. (Hint, use a `WHERE ___ is null` clause and an outer join)

3. Write a query that returns just the name of authors who haven't written any books.

4. Write a query that includes the title, author(s), and each review rating, but only for books that have at least one review.

5. Modify your query from #4 to include all books, regardless of whether or not they have any reviews.

6. Write a query that identifies which books don't have a book_fulltext record.

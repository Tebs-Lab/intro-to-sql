# What is a Database

* A program that's designed to store data.
* There are many kinds, we're looking at "relational" databases.
* These are organized into tables, which are made of rows and columns.
* SQL (standard query language) is what we use to access and modify these data.
* There are many implementations of relational databases and SQL
    * PostgreSQL
    * MySQL
    * OracleDB
    * ...

## DBMS vs Databse

* A Dabase Management System provides tools and capabilities in addition to the raw storage.
* DBMS might include a server, administration tools, and more.
* We're primarally focused on using administrative tools to access databases using SQL in this class.

# Views

* Views are essentially stored queries that have been given a name. 
* Very useful if you make a particular query repeatedly, and want to expose it to other users of the database.
* The syntax is also simple:

```sql
create view [name_of_view] as (
    [any query you want, no matter how complex]
)
```

* This section is short because the exercises are difficult and cumulative. Plus, views really are simple!

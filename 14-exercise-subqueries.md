# Exercise: Subqueries

Write a SQL query for each of the following prompts

1. Compute the total amount of revenue generated by the sales person with the highest number of all-time sales. (`sales.salesorderheader` and `sales.salesorderdetail`, you'll need a group by in both the subquery AND the main query.)

2. Select every `sale.salesorderdetail` whose `orderqty` is within 5 units (in either direction) of the average `orderqty`

3. Select every `person.address` which comes from the least common two countries (based on the values in `person.address` not based on sales data or anything else.)

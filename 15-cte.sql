/*

* Common table expressions are a way to use queries as though they are tables.
    * The queries are not actually "materialized" into a table and so they take up very little space on disk.
    * However, they are executed and the result of the query is held in memory until the rest of the expression is completed.
* CTE's make some things that would be impossible possible, and they make other things that might otherwise be very hard much easier.
* There are two syntaxes... lets see them:

select name from (
  select * from production.product
) as temp_table;

-- and equivilantly:

with temp_table as (
    select * from production.product
)

select name from temp_table;

/*
* These are useful for many reasons, for example:
    * Improve readability with deep joins and especially recursive joins.
    * Allow for multiple levels of aggregation.
    * Aggregation over union/intersect/except operations.
    * (and others...)

* Lets see an example of a useful CTE...
